# customer-lifetime-value-analysis
This analysis was created for a use case assignment from a company for a step within their hiring process. Customer lifetime value is one of the most important and most used metrics to measure the quality of a product or business. In this analysis, I tried to answer, given the dataset provided, which cohort of users should product A focus on based on their customer lifetime value. Moreover, I also built a predictive model using a simple linear regression to predict each cohort's value given i, where i is the number of days from the first install date.

Have fun analysing and inferring the use case, and best of luck if you are working on a use case for an interview!
